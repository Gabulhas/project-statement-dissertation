\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I extend my deepest gratitude to my family, who have always been my cornerstone. To my friends and colleagues at the Release Lab, thank you for making the long hours of coding and debugging bearable, and for the endless intake of coffee, no matter its quality, from the bar downstairs.

A special thank you goes to my girlfriend, who has been my steadfast companion throughout the majority of this project and thesis journey. You were often the only audience to my thesis monologues, listening attentively even when the jargon got too dense. Your presence made the journey not just bearable, but enjoyable.

I am immensely grateful to my coordinator, Professor Sim√£o Melo de Sousa. Your guidance has been invaluable, and your friendship has enriched this academic journey, making it more than just a series of deadlines and milestones.

I would also like to express my gratitude to Vincent Botbol. Your timely assistance helped me overcome one of the most challenging hurdles in this project. Your help was the missing semicolon in my long string of code.

Last but not least, a nod to my cats. Thank you for being there during my most challenging times, even if your idea of support was occasionally walking across my keyboard or napping on my lap.
