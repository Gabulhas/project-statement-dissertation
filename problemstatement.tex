\section{The Problem}
The development of blockchain technology has led to the creation of a large number of consensus protocols, each with its unique characteristics, from the selection of the leader, to the type of network, data structure, block structure, time between each block, and multiple ways to have a chain, to name just a few. Newer and innovative protocols are designed ``everyday'' with totally different characteristics compared to previous protocols.
This abundance of choices has made it difficult for individuals or organizations looking to start their own blockchain to determine which protocol is the best fit for their needs, as there's a lot to account for.

Furthermore, there is no easy way to test and compare these consensus protocols in a live, non-simulated environment.
There is no blockchain node software that allow for a seamless swap of the consensus algorithm, making it challenging to properly evaluate the performance of each protocol. This presents a major obstacle for researchers and developers looking to experiment with and improve upon existing consensus protocols.

Additionally, the process of designing and coding a new consensus algorithm is also challenging and requires a significant amount of expertise and resources. There is currently no platform that allows for the easy design, swap, and testing of new consensus algorithms.


All these problems contribute to the lack of standardization in the field of consensus protocols, a lot of attributes and characteristic to take in, making it difficult for individuals and organizations to adopt blockchain technology effectively.
It is crucial to find a solution that allows for the easy and efficient comparison and testing of consensus protocols, as well as the design and implementation of new protocols. This will pave the way for the further development and widespread adoption of blockchain technology.
